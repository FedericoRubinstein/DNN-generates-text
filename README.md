# Deep Neural Network Generates Text

This project is started as an academic project for a course on Deep Learning.
The goal of this project is to learn about Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Networks by creating a model that, given a sequence of characters, can generate more text by predicting the next character.


## Usage
This was coded using Google Colab, but can also be run on a Jupyter Notebook. However, to obtain similar results as the ones shown in the notebook, I recommend using Google Colab.
